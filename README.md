# TipCalculator

This code is a Python script for a tip calculator. It calculates the amount each person needs to pay for a bill split among a certain number of people, including a tip percentage specified by the user.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

It starts by printing a welcome message for the tip calculator.
It prompts the user to input the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage (10%, 12%, or 15%), and the number of people splitting the bill.
It calculates the total tip amount based on the input tip percentage.
It calculates the total bill amount by adding the bill and the tip amount.
It divides the total bill amount by the number of people to get the amount each person should pay.
It rounds the final amount to two decimal places.
Finally, it prints out the amount each person should pay.
The code is designed to handle user input for the bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people. It calculates the total bill including the tip and then divides it by the number of people to determine the amount each person needs to pay.
